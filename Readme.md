# Workout Planner

This is a small personal project with the following goals:

- Reduce friction to get started with a home workout in the morning.
- Avoid procrastination during the workout.

The webapp tries to achieve these goals by:

- Automatically generating a simple workout based on some user settings.
- Having a continuously running timer that would have to be stopped manually to procrastinate.
- Use text-to-speech to announce what to do next, to avoid having to interact with the phone.
